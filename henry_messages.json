goes in its shell", "i havent even done that bc my shield doesnt work", "yeah once i actually get a good shield i wont any more", "the rolling deer", "yeah it is", "this is the first souls game that im consistently two handing", "yeah that what ive been doing", "so thats fine", "but it is dark sousl", "anyway the main issue is i just die if im like hit by any enemy", "yeah the buffs are good", "i always like healing bc it sorta just let you last longer but there already a mechanic for that", "im hoping the later miracles are better", "i've found like one enemy that it actually works on", "the other miracle is a melee range attack spell and its just like hard to get off without dying", "heal meaning the spell", "cause you dont really run out of estus unless you're fighting a big enemy and you dont really have time to heal anyway with those", "healing is pretty good but its definitely worse in elden ring than other games", "but the only attack spell is melee range", "the spear is a pretty good weapon i guess", "so i actually have to learn how to dodge", "and the shield is awful", "the issue with my starting class is it essentially starts with no armor", "so im curious what you guys did", "i started as whatever the cleric is called bc thats just my souls game tradition but i feel like its actually an awful starting class", "what classes did you guys start as", "when they make the best game ever made but its 1 fps", "But my ps4 is just bad so it makes sense", "Also it's mostly fixed now but my ps4 would just sometimes cut out the music randomly and it was annoying", "I

enough its just boring", "yeah the issue is like", "so changing the difficulty ruins that", "but not too much", "you should be rewarded for doing the side quests", "its like", "which feels bad to me",

difficulty shatters the illusion that the game is hard", "yeah but that like bothers me", "The one bad thing about God of war is doing like any side quest makes the main quests too easy", "Jamie

it wil become obvious if and when someone creates something thats conscious", "that i feel is more likely to be correct than anything ive thought of", "i mean this is just my random theory", "i think that humans couldn't accidentally make conciousness", "bc it doesnt make sense for people to just be magically sentient", "or somethign that functions like a \"soul\"", "i think that there is probably

humans arent sentient", "i mean i already understood that argument in my own way", "ok i see what they're trying to say", "so whats the argument where that proves robots arent sentient", "but thats not the point here", "do not worry i plan to", "bc analogies do not prove anything", "oh so its just an analogy?", "lol i dont really get what that says about consciousness", "or question or wahtever", "isnt that just a definitional argument", "i dont believe that finn owsley is a human", "humans fake confirmed", "babyies dont have conscoiousness?", "i just wanna know about

does have consciousness", "i think the pertinent question is, if you created something that was exactly like a human in all physical ways, would it have consciousness", "i got to the android sex part", "yeah im confused what source you're gettign this info from benn", "oh wait ben is saying they dont have consciousness", "yeah how do you know that they have any consciousness at all", "that would solve the ethical dilmmea", "they will totally believe you", "the big brain thing to do would be to tell the npcs in the video game that you are actually a human playing a video game where you cotnrol the androids so therefore you know the androids have consciousness", "ok wait", "so you should obviously treat them liek their conscious", "in detroit: become human, androids are clearly conscious bc you literally play as an android", "ok wait im stupid", "what do you do if you have a choice where if you take it it will have a negative impact on all people combined but if you treat the android as a person it has a positive impact on all people combined", "like the qeustion is", "but its true that that question arises", "i feel like scenarios where the  affect on the world will change from negative to positive if you include the experience of a single android are going to be few", "hmm ur right", "bc the androids can respond negatively making the world a worse place", "i treat androids nicely bc it has the utilitarian purpose making the world a better place for actual conscious humans", "ok i retract my reasoning", "bc i definitely do things based on just the general

The guy next to me asked him if he would play a 2 5 1 progression, and Adam neely informed him that asking that question was actually an act of white supremacy.

objective of the game is to win two points.\n\nYou win a point by winning a round.\n\n\nHOW A ROUND WORKS\n\nFirst, each player places a coin in the center, face-down.\n\nNext, each player in turn adds one more coin to the top of their own center stack until someone starts the bid by stating a number of coins they believe they can reveal and get only flowers.\n\nOnce the bidding phase begins, players may no longer place coins. They must raise the bid or pass.\n\nAfter everyone else has passed, the player with the highest bid must then flip that number of coins, starting with all of the ones in their own stack first (from top to bottom).\n\nIf the player reveals only flowers, they win the round and gain a point; if they reveal a skull, they lose the round and get one randomly-selected coin removed from their hand.\n\n\nADDITIONAL RULES\n\nFirst round, the person with the most boring shirt on starts. Each subsequent round, the player who last flipped a coin starts.\n\nYou must flip all of your own placed coins (top to bottom) first before you may flip anyone else's.\n\nWhen flipping others' coins, you must flip their top-most unflipped coin.\n\nYou don't have to flip all of a player's coins before flipping someone else's coin.\n\nOnce you pass, you may no longer bid during the remainder of the round.\n\nOnce your hand is empty you are out.\n\nIf you are the only player left with coins, you also win.", "pkhem does not like the rain", "its only gonna take him 4 hours", "neil can walk his dog", "dont be lete", "except haha i just finished preppin bc i already was for the past hour", "i guess i better start ***preppin***", "<@&737008535744938004> monday 6-9?", "im not around until 4", "probably after 5", "does monday happen to work for everyoen?", "ok so i also dont think we can do dnd next thursady either so it would be nice to squeeze one in *somewhere* during the next two weeks", "yeah weekends wont work for me once i get back to work", "makes sense", "would the sunday time work again?", "weell be back soon", "its been 20 min", "Idk why but when I saw that the tetris beat boxing guy entered my head", "<@&737008535744938004> Sunday 12-4 then?", "yeah we can just start earlier", "i'd like people to say when they're available", "well actually", "does sunday sometime work for peopole?", "its looking like tomorrow wont work either", "hoepfully yays", "can we get some yays and nays", "ok so 3-6?", "<@&737008535744938004> ok it turns out Thursday won't work.

Meanwhile, the other creature\u2019s shots had worn off. This creature was a strange tusked devil that looked male, with a crossbow and a seemingly endless variety of bolts. After missing Quildar and Nubs, he saw that his mission was accomplished and turned invisible to escape the war machines. Unfortunately for him, he hadn\u2019t banked on Gizmo\u2019s invisibility sight. Kehnam was able to lead everyone to attack him, and he was barraged by a combination of Nubs\u2019 lightning, Mynt\u2019s eldritch powers, and finally, Kehnam\u2019s classic shadow blade.\n    Looking hurt, the creature put his hands up, warning that any more damage would cause him to explode. Eliza surrendered as well, clearly not wanting to lose her companion. She promised to give up the lute and her 10 soul coins, as well as sign an agreement that they could never harm you again. Unfortunately, she was unable to divulge the identity of her employer, as she had signed a contract forbidding her from doing so. You left the pair, quite a bit richer, but uncomfortable at the thought of more enemies at your back.", "As Mephistopheles was unwilling to give the location of such a creature, or even of the Wandering Emporium, you were left to decide where to go next. With no way to cross the River Styx, it seemed that going back to Mad Maggie was the best option. Yafeek chose that moment to remember another useful piece of information: the dock that Zariel uses to refuel her flying fortress could likely be moved into a bridge shape, allowing crossing of the River Styx by war machines. Spurred on by Annie and Kehnam, you decided to head for Mordenkainen, hoping for just a smidgen of his great wisdom on what to do next.\n    Only half an hour away from the Mirror, a shape suddenly flew down in front of you. It was Eliza, a bounty hunter sent after Annie to retrieve the magic lute. Although she wouldn\u2019t reveal the identity of her employer, she offered a deal: she would give 10 soul coins for the lute to be given over and no blood shed. Annie resisted, asking to speak to Eliza\u2019s employer, but Eliza found this unreasonable. After it was clear negotiation would go nowhere, Eliza\u2019s invisible companion shot Mynt, blinding everyone in the group except for her.", "Everyone else approached much more carefully to the mirror. Kehnam walked up with his eyes closed, but was too curious to contain himself. He opened his eyes and was able to resist the effects of the mirror, tearing his gaze away from himself. As he watched, he saw a figure fly out of a tower far off in the mirror. As others approached, Quildar and Nubs incidentally looked in the mirror, becoming frozen for a few seconds before Naudi freed them. \n    Finally, the figure reached the mirror. It was a blue skinned winged creature, looking half like a human and half like a devil. His face was frozen in a scream. In order to speak, he poured a kettle of boiling water on his face before every sentence. He introduced himself as Rigorath, Mephistopheles\u2019 emissary. He refused to let anyone speak with his master, asserting that all deals would go through him. He appeared to already know of your search for the Sword of Zariel, and put forth a deal: your group would gain knowledge and wisdom, and one secret of your choice, if you brought Mephistopheles a pint of blood of a creature as powerful as a balor or pit fiend, or more powerful. You hesitantly agreed to this deal, which Rigorath scratched into the ice, forming it into solid ice on your side of the mirror. Kehnam read the deal over, concluding that it was solid and didn\u2019t have any chance of backfiring on you. You then drank the melted ice, sealing the deal.", "After 3 days of travel, you finally began to get close to the Mirror. As you got close, Mynt suddenly hopped off the machine and ran towards the mirror. Seeing this, Kehnam sprinted after her, hoping to be the first one to contact Mephistopheles. Meanwhile, Nubs found out something extraordinary: his map talks. As you approached, it said \u201cMirror mirror, made of ice - look within, but at what price\u201d. Unable to get more information out of the map, he yelled for Mynt and Kehnam to come back, but they were unresponsive. Quildar and Naudi, the quickest members of the party, ran after them. Naudi attempted to grab Mynt, thinking that Kehnam was also trying to stop Mynt. Mynt got away, but Quildar was able to stun her with a strike to the neck.\n    Seeing this, Kehnam sprinted past, but Nubs stopped him with Entanglement. Mynt, freed from Quildar\u2019s strike, quickly teleported towards the mirror and finally saw the reflection. It showed an icy, glacial version of her surroundings. As she locked eyes with herself in the mirror, she saw a soulless version of her that was encrusted with ice. She froze, and felt all her memories, knowledge, and fears flash in front of her. Naudi inspected her, and stood in front of her, breaking eye contact with the mirror and breaking the spell.", "Mirror Mirror, Made of Ice\n    After defeating Raggadragga, you went on your way to the Mirror. You soon reached the area that the map showed as a massive pit, with tentacles reaching out of the ground. Hoping to detour around the pit, you headed north, but didn\u2019t get too far before a massive tentacle came out of the ground, smashing the Demon Grinder and ripping some of the armor plate off. Mynt quickly smushed the tentacle with the wrecking ball, but it took Naudi a couple tries to repair the armor, and the machine had a bit more wear and tear on it. \n    After detouring north of the pit, the engines of the war machines shut off, their initial fuel running out. Using 2 soul coins to power each machine, you continued on your way for quite a while, before finally taking some time to rest. This rest, however, was very fitful as the plains of Avernus are not a comfortable place to sleep. In the morning, you discussed next steps. Lulu had remembered more about the two paladins that accompanied Zariel. The one who signed the contract and became a devil was named Haruman, while the reanimated one was Olanthius. The pit fiend, of course, was Bel, the previous ruler of Avernus. It seemed to be the preference of the party to find Olanthius, as it seemed he would be more amenable to negotiation. However, it was unclear how his body would still be intact after all this time.", "After much deliberation, you decided to head towards the Mirror to Mephistar, thinking that it would be difficult to cross the River Styx and go anywhere else. Mad Maggie, grateful after everything you had done to help her, decided to give you a Tormentor to help you in the long trek, along with 3 soul coins, 2 weeks of rations each, and some more information about the warlords of Avernus. First, she mentioned the upstart warlord Raggadragga, who has gathered a team of lycanthropes to gain power in Avernus. She reminded you of Bitter Breath, the horned devil who can\u2019t speak. She also told you about Feonor, an icy mage who drives around Avernus looking for bodies to add to her undead army. Finally, she told you of Princeps Kovik, a cruel chain devil who\u2019s Infantry Legion was destroyed in the Blood War. He\u2019s gathered the survivors of his legion into the Eighth Remnant, and hopes to gain enough power to strike back at the demons.\n    Thankful for the information, you left Fort Knucklebone after a nice rest. Soon after the fort went out of sight, you saw a plume of smoke in the distance. Soon you saw Raggadragga and his gang screaming towards you in a Demon Grinder, a much larger vehicle than you had. While everyone was deciding what to do, Mynt quickly slowed the vehicle, giving Nubs time to cast Wall of Fire around the vehicle, Kehnam giving them no chance of avoiding it with Hypnotic Pattern. 2 wererats were destroyed, but Raggadragga kept coming, knowing that your vehicle stood no chance against his massive wrecking ball. As his mind was still dazed by the slow spell, Quildar and Naudi leaped onto his vehicle, the others shooting from afar. Quildar managed to pull Raggadragga out of the driver\u2019s seat, causing the vehicle to crash against a wall. Defeating the warlord, you looted his 3 soul coins and acquired his vehicle, leaving you much more powerful.", "First, Lulu and everyone else saw Zariel defeated at the hands of a massive pit fiend, her arm, along with her sword, cut off and sent flying. By her were two human paladins. The next vision showed those four in front of a massive devil seated in a throne. He said something that you couldn\u2019t make out, then produced a contract, while the pit fiend screamed in protest. Zariel quickly signed, transforming into her current devil form, while one of her bodyguards did a second later. The other paladin quickly slit his throat with a knife he had hidden. As the dream ended, you saw Zariel begin to reanimate her dead companion\u2026.\n    As the dream ended, it became clear that the meaning of the dream was that those three, plus Zariel and who you assumed to be Asmodeus, were the only ones who might know the true location of the Sword of Zariel, and therefore the alabaster castle around it that Torm mentioned. Mad Maggie had no clue where to go to find them, but recommended a fellow hag, Red Ruth, who might know a thing or two about how to find them. Yafeek, tired of meeting with hags, suggested to Kehnam that you meet with Mephistopheles, aided by a mirror that ostensibly went to his lair, Mephistar. Meanwhile, Barnabas had finished his research, and said in hushed tones to Annie that Naudi of course overheard that her contract most likely was made with whoever was above the imp she killed in the chain of command. Further, he warned that that person would probably want the lute back, seeing it as going against the contract made with the imp. He suggested Annie go to Mordenkainen, who might have a way to stop the tracking part of the contract. Plus, he might be able to find one of the three you were trying to find.", "The dream faded, and the first thing you saw were rainbows. You then saw Lulu standing next to Zariel in a beautiful green landscape. Seeing that this was just what Lulu wanted to see, Maggie urged you to push on through the dream. Most of you had an easy enough time doing this, although Nubs\u2019 stubborn desire to reach the goal as fast as possible made it difficult for him to accept that there was more to be seen. In the next dream, an injured Lulu and Zariel were attacked by spined devils. As you fended them off, the dream faded, showing three injured but not killed devils begging for mercy.\n    Although Nubs resisted the idea, the devils pleaded that they would help you in exchange for their lives. Figuring that in Lulu\u2019s mind, even devils would honor such an agreement, you accepted. In the next dream, you were weighed down by an unnatural heaviness, and black muck started to rise around you. While it was difficult to shake off the despair and get out of the muck, the three devils began to help, leaving Annie as the only one to not survive. At the end of the dream, you saw Lulu look into an eyeglass, seeing visions of Zariel during that fateful battle:", "Sweet Dreams\n    Heading back to Fort Knucklebone after getting the last hezrou spike, you saw that Mad Maggie had almost finished preparing for the dream ritual. Taking a quick rest after the grueling battle, Nubs brought Annie out of unconsciousness for the second time that day. It seemed that everyone in the fort was happy, and that there was no more business to take care of. Meanwhile, Mynt decided to sneakily explore the fort. In one room, she found the barracks that the redcaps slept in. In another, she found the skull Barnabas researching Mordenkainen, admitting that it was a favor for Annie. She also found a room that seemed dedicated to the making of flesh golems, and Chukka and Clonk\u2019s room where parts for the machines are stored.\n    Finally, it was time for the ritual. Maggie had set up an infernal circle, and placed pillows for Lulu to rest on in the center. She also took 2 skulls, apparently her sisters, and set them in the circle. She then asked you to sit in the circle. She explained that the ritual would connect everyone telepathically, and the ritual would end if you left the circle. She also explained that any damage done in the ritual would not be physical, and that if you died in the dream you would fall to a normal state of sleep in real life. Mad Maggie was eager to see into Lulu\u2019s dream, hoping that her connection with Zariel would show something very personal to her.", "Roaring down the plains, you quickly found the two hezrou. First Naudi and Mynt pulled ahead to distract and separate the two demons, and Annie drove forward, running into one demon. Quildar grabbed it with the claw, and Kehnam went to work chopping spikes off the hezrou. This was clearly easier said than done, as the hezrou let off an awful stench that made anything near it difficult. \nNaudi absolutely styled on everyone, doing tricks left and right with the Ride, and Nubs threw everything he had at the demon to keep it distracted. Mynt had the other demon on her tail, but a spell went awry, causing it to jump on the Scavenger knocking the other demon out of the claw. Quildar was able to claw up the other demon, and Mynt\u2019s spell kept it aggressive enough to not escape the claw, attacking those inside the car. \nAnnie used her control of the Scavenger to ram the demon in the claw into walls, eventually collapsing a pillar on top of it. Kehnam and Quildar were able to chop off 3 spikes, but Annie was knocked out by the never-ending assault of the hezrou. Chukka stepped in to steer the machine out of harm's way, and you sped off back to Fort Knucklebone with 3 spikes in hand.", "Everyone else was looking for Naudi because she had the best chance at catching Wazzik by surprise. Nubs was able to give Annie a healing potion, and they left her to recover as they ambushed Wazzik. He went down quickly, unable to alert his companions, and a pleased Pins and Needles divulged the location of two hezrou. Meanwhile, Annie returned to Barnabas with the tooth, and he promised to consult his books to help answer her questions.\nWith the hezrou spotted, you were finally ready to get going. Chukka and Clonk loaded up a large war machine called a Scavenger with a claw to pick up the demon, and two Devil\u2019s Rides that were functionally motorcycles. Naudi grabbed one Ride, with Nubs hitching a ride on the back, while Mynt grabbed the second Ride. Everyone else piled into the Scavenger, and Annie convinced Chukka to let her drive.", "Meanwhile, Annie had noticed something strange: a floating skull searching for something. She sneaked off, but Naudi noticed her and followed even more stealthily. Annie learned that the skull\u2019s name was Barnabas, and that he was searching for his tooth, which the redcaps had knocked out of his mouth. It would damage his pride too much to ask Maggie to help, so he was pleased that Annie had approached. He promised to help her figure out the nature of the deal she had made if she helped him. He remembered that the tooth was taken by a redcap named Grubba, but had no idea which one that was.\nAnnie attempted to join a game of bones among the redcaps, but was turned away with surprising hostility. Eventually, she managed to join a game of bones, with the hope that Grubba would turn up somewhere. Annie was able to cheat handily to tie up the game with another redcap, provoking a fight to determine the winner. It suddenly became clear that the fight was to the death, however. One of the redcaps let slip that it was Grubba she was fighting, and she used her lute to cast fireball over all the redcaps at the game. After killing Grubba, she turned invisible to fight the other two, and managed to finish off one before getting knocked out by their wicked shoe blades. Naudi finished off the last one, grabbed the pouch with the tooth, and carried Annie out.", "Meanwhile, Kehnam discovered that the problem with the machine was a gear made from the spines of a hezrou demon. Chukka and Clonk needed to find a hezrou to grab some spikes from, but couldn\u2019t get the redcaps\u2019 help, as they\u2019d just gleefully kill the demon. You all decided it would help put you in Maggie\u2019s good favor if you helped fix her machine. Unfortunately, you still didn\u2019t know the location of a hezrou. Chukka and Clonk suggested asking Pins and Needles, Maggie\u2019s imps, to help.\nKehnam approached the imps, with much of the party behind him, and asked them to find a demon. Clearly lazy and adverse to work, they asked Kehnam to kill a redcap named Wazzik, claiming he was planning on killing Lulu. Kehnam reluctantly agreed, but Quildar sensed something off with the situation. He, Nubs, and Mynt convinced the imps to start looking for the hezrou right away, with the promise that they\u2019d sing your praises to Maggie if you offed Wazzik.", "Mynt noticed that there was something lodged in his foot, but wasn\u2019t able to convince him to raise it. Eventually, it was Nubs\u2019 gruff demeanor that convinced the golem to raise his foot. Everyone watched with bated breath as Quildar attempted to pull the bone out of the foot, but as tired as he was from the trek across Avernus, he couldn\u2019t get it out without hurting the creature. As an involuntary reaction, it lashed out against Quildar, and he was only barely able to dodge. When it became clear Quildar wasn\u2019t up to the task, Naudi tried her hand, but Mickey had had enough. \nWhile Mickey went on a rampage, Mynt went to find Maggie, with Annie tailing behind her. Quildar tried to land a few punches, while Naudi grabbed Mickey from behind. Nubs, in monkey form, took the brunt of the assault from the golem. Finally, Maggie came by and was able to calm Mickey down. After Maggie convinced him to lift his foot one last time, Nubs was able to extract the bone and heal the damage caused from everyone\u2019s sloppiness. Still, Maggie seemed a bit peeved at the whole situation.", "Mad Maggie approached with a fiendish flesh golem trailing behind her, and stared with wonder at Lulu. Identifying her as Zariel\u2019s companion, Maggie quickly agreed to prepare a dream ritual that would help unlock more of Lulu\u2019s memories, eager to gain more information on Zariel\u2019s fall from grace. In the meantime, she allowed you to wander the Fort at your leisure. Lulu, when asked if she had seen the two kenku, remembered being found by them when wandering the plains of Avernus. The kenku said that they found her and brought her to the Wandering Emporium, a collection of shops that roams Avernus.\n    Seeing that the kenku were puzzling over one of the machines, Kehnam and Naudi decided to investigate. The kenku, introducing themselves as Chukka and Clonk, although Clonk rarely spoke, were stumped on why the vehicle wasn\u2019t working. Naudi tried but soon gave up figuring it out, but Kehnam seemed to have something worked out. In the meantime, everyone else saw that the flesh golem was limping badly on one foot. As he hopped about, the redcaps began to dance around him, singing \u201cDo the Mickey\u201d and mimicking his painful hop.", "Fort Knucklebone\n    It became clear on the way to the fort that the plains of Avernus is no place for the lighthearted. Quildar, Annie, and Mynt all became exhausted by the journey. You also noticed the strange new lute that Annie had somehow acquired. She said it was given to her by Subelle, but privately most believed that it had been stolen. As you approached the fort, you saw that it was ringed by a wall of debris, metal, and bones. Inside was a hill that looked strikingly like a hand rising from the ground. At this sight, Nubs remembered the name of Mad Maggie\u2019s home: Fort Knucklebone.\n    Deciding that it would be better to approach with diplomacy than with stealth or violence, you walked towards the wall. Atop the wall were 6 strange creatures that looked like feral gnomes wearing giant red caps. They taunted you for a bit, telling you to do strange things to gain entry, until Annie told a joke that seemed to satisfy the creatures. Inside, you saw two Kenku working on a strange vehicle, who seemed to immediately recognize Lulu. One ran to get Mad Maggie, the resident warlord.", "After Naudi gathered some people she knew from Elturel who would be able to help make the gliders, you all got to work. Three gliders were made, and one faulty design was almost let through before Annie caught it. Nubs quickly made sure it was remade to Torm\u2019s specifications, and you prepared to launch off. Grabbing some extra rations, you bid farewell to the friends you were leaving behind, and after Kehnam used Fly on Quildar and Naudi, you left Elturel.\nThe flight down went surprisingly well, although Annie had to use fireball to give you enough lift to make it past the rear of the devil army. The blood war was quite a view, but you quickly were past it and on your way to the fort. As you landed, you realized that the journey would be difficult. The oppressive atmosphere of hell itself went beyond physical exhaustion, but was clearly mental as well.", "As research took a very long time, Naudi spent some time rooting through buildings to find a silvered rapier, and luckily, she was able to find a weapon that suited. Meanwhile, Nubs, unsure of whether they would be able to fly far enough to make it past the devil forces of the blood war, decided to use the Helm of Torm\u2019s Sight to find some answers. After putting on the Helm, he felt the presence of Baphomet, which had not been purged from the Helm fully. Still, he was able to commune with Torm.\nFirst, he asked whether they would find Mad Maggie in the fort they had seen. Torm gave Nubs a very positive vision that showed a hag standing within the fort. He then asked if there was a safer way down from Elturel. Torm was able to quickly identify many different possible glider designs, and show Nubs which design had the best chance of success. Finally, Nubs asked if Torm or any other god had the power to break a devil\u2019s contract. Torm gave a very complex vision that seemed to outline the extent of a devil\u2019s power: it was limited in some way, but that same limit also limits the ability of a god to interfere. Satisfied with these answers, Nubs went to work.", "Meanwhile, Gizmo was flying high above Elturel to figure out where they were on their map. Naudi used her beast sense to look through Gizmo\u2019s eyes, seeing a far-off fort that placed their location near the top of the map. Gizmo seemed excited when looking at the fort, probably because of the strange infernal vehicles that he had never seen before. Realizing that those machines would probably be very useful on your journey, you decided that that fort would be your first destination. \nDuring all this, Annie was practicing her lute when she was approached by an imp. The imp promised her a magical lute, if she was willing to sign a contract giving the imp her location, ostensibly so that he could keep her apprised of his deeds so she could write a song about him. After convincing the imp, named Givel, to let her try out the lute, she cast magic missile, instantly killing him. As the contract had not been signed, the lute was pulled back to where it came from, but Annie held onto it long enough to sign the contract in Givel\u2019s blood and keep the lute in her possession. While she purposely misspelled her name, it was unclear if the deal was binding, or who she made the deal with\u2026.", "Mad Maggie is a night hag who came to Avernus to experience the ultimate misery. She was of special interest to Nubs as she is an expert in dreams and memories, and could be the key to unlocking Lulu\u2019s memories. His research also told him that she was fairly kindly to those who were civil with her, although she could be vicious to those who bothered her. The other warlord he found info on was a pit fiend named L\u2019zeth who was politically aligned with Bel when Zariel came into power. Zariel demoted him into a horned devil. Angered, he became part of a plot to overthrow Zariel, but was found out and was cursed so that any words he uttered would turn to smoke. Bitter Breath has joined forces with a group of hobgoblins and has become one of the most feared warlord in Avernus.\nMynt couldn\u2019t find much on her own, but Nicole was able to help her find a lot of information on the Companion. She learned that a powerful magic item such as the Sword of Zariel could shatte the Companion. Additionally, it seemed that the Companion was built in Bel\u2019s forge, and that he might know of a way to open it. Finally, she learned that an extremely powerful being such as Tiamat might be able to destroy Companion. It was much harder to find information on how to bring Elturel back to the material plane.", "Kehnam determined that devil deals could be broken by killing the devil, tricking it into presenting the contract and then destroying it, or the devil could willingly end the deal. Contracts could also be broken by finding and destroying the contract, but seeing as it was a pretty major contract, it was most likely hidden in Asmodeus\u2019 vaults on Nessus. He also learned that while breaking the contract would destroy the chains binding Elturel to Avernus, it wouldn\u2019t destroy the Companion.\n    Nubs\u2019 research gave him a bit of confidence in building various contraptions that could help you get off Elturel. He also learned that the chains binding Elturel to Avernus wouldn\u2019t be that difficult to climb down, as they had long barbs covering them. He also realized that it would be quite simple to make a deal with a devil to get down. He also did some research concerning powerful creatures on Avernus. In his research, he learned about two powerful Avernian warlords: Mad Maggie and Bitter Breath.", "Torm\u2019s Gliders\u2122\n    As Ravengard finally emerged from his trance, plans began to form for saving Elturel. First, Kehnam made sure that everyone was going to be ready for the journey, afraid of doing the same thing to them as they had done to Subelle. Mynt said something about it being what her patron wanted, while Naudi wordlessly nodded agreement. Annie was unsure, until Ravengard promised riches and titles to any saviour of Elturel. Kehnam quickly grabbed the Helm, but eventually gave it to Nubs. Rey and Ravengard both decided to stay in Elturel, feeling that their place was with the city.\n    Ravengard recommended that research be done into exactly how Elturel could be saved, as Torm\u2019s vision was very vague. After a good night\u2019s rest, Kehnam, Nubs, and Mynt, along with an escort provided by Subelle and a librarian named Nicole, went to the library to see what they could learn. It soon became clear that two things would need to be done to save Elturel: break the chains binding it to Avernus, and destroy the Companion. Mynt decided to focus her research on the Companion, while Nubs focused his efforts on finding a way down from Elturel that wouldn\u2019t land them smack dab in the middle of the blood war. Kehnam focused on researching devil deals.", "Quildar decided to take on the most difficult part of the mission, resting his quarterstaff on the Helm. Pherria started chanting a prayer to Torm in front of an altar, and it was immediately clear that Quildar was in for a rough ride. His body started convulsing but he was in a trance, completely at the will of the vision. Out of the Helm came four Will-o\u2019-Wisps that seemed intent on killing Pherria and Quildar. With the help of Seltern the druid, you were able to save Quildar, although Pherria was killed by the wisps, and Kehnam had to take her place in chanting the prayer. \n    Coming out of the vision, Quildar recounted what he had seen:\nIn his spirit journey, Quildar saw a bloodied woman in armor--a soldier wearing the colors and crest of Elturel--grasping a longsword fit for an angel. Fresh blood streamed from a nasty cut on the woman\u2019s cheek.\nFlying next to the woman was a small, golden elephant with rapidly fluttering wings that Quildar quickly realized was Lulu.\nAs an enormous, loping demon threatened to devour the woman, she plunged the sword into the ground while Lulu made a trumpet sound with its trunk. The demon was hurled back as an alabaster palace rose up around the sword. Lulu fled and took the red sky of Avernus, where she watched as a bloody scab grew up from the ground to engulf the palace and the enormous demon.\nAs the vision reached its end, Quildar heard a message from Torm: \u201cWhile my power is weak, I can see all the possible futures where Elturel is saved. There are many paths you can take, but all that end in saving Elturel pass through this palace.\u201d", "Very weak but committed, you headed back to the High Hall. On the way, Naudi, who was scouting on the rooftops, noticed a terrifying armored devil riding a fiery horse. She quickly warned everyone and they hid in a building as it passed by. Lulu told you that it was a narzugon, a paladin that had given up its soul, and it was very powerful. \n    Back at the High Hall, you brought Ravengard to Pherria, whose expertise in possession was sure to help. Mynt was able to determine through telepathy with Ravengard that the demon in conflict with Torm was Baphomet, the demon prince of minotaurs. Pherria quickly suggested a ritual that could help free Torm and cast Baphomet out of the Helm. Knowing it would likely be dangerous, you decided to rest up before undertaking the ritual.", "Nubs\u2019 control over the lightning storm gave him some measure of control over the pits. He was able to use one to attack Gideon, and later used them to protect Quildar. Meanwhile, Kehnam had created a blade of shadow and was fending off attacks from a crowd of minotaur skeletons. Lulu backed him up with trumpet blasts that shot sparkles at the undead, dissolving their skin. It soon became clear that Gideon was barely taking any damage, but he was scared of Lulu and Quildar. He quickly knocked out Lulu before running back into cover. Quildar saw this and, in a fit of anger, ran from where he was fighting to hit Gideon. His quarterstaff, doing radiant damage, completely pushed the necromantic energy that was protecting Gideon away. With just a few hits, Gideon was knocked down.\n    However, Gideon was not finished. He rose back up as a banshee, letting out a scream that knocked out Quildar and Kehnam, the two closest to him. The others were able to resist the scream, and Nubs quickly healed Lulu. Quildar miraculously came back to consciousness, and with everyone else\u2019s help, finally finished off Gideon.", "Torm\u2019s Vision\n    Picking Ravengard up and quickly running out of the cemetery, you came face to face with Gideon Lightward. Seeing the man he believed responsible for the arrival of the demons, and hearing him speaking in Abyssal, he demanded that Ravengard be handed over immediately so that he could kill him. You refused, and Mynt attempted to charm Gideon, but it was clear he had gained more power since you last saw him: three new pits of purple light were soaking power into him, clearly the result of the rumbling you heard. He easily shook off Mynt\u2019s spell, and proceeded to attack.\n    You initially started off on the back foot. Gideon was a blur as he moved around the battlefield, able to attack as fast as Quildar, and throw in a few deadly gazes in the meantime. Anytime someone created some sort of threat, he knocked them down with a gaze. Additionally, he had zombies and skeletons as his front lines, and was able to avoid most melee combat. As things started going badly, Lulu glowed with a golden light, healing everyone on the battlefield. Nubs was able to back away and control the storm of the Companion, pelting Gideon with lightning bolts. Gideon also had control of three pits filled with the energy of the Companion, using it to spawn new undead creatures, reach out and hurt Gideon\u2019s enemies, and give Gideon extra layers of protection.", "As you stepped closer, a creature walked out of a strange portal in the back of the room. This creature was an ugly demon, with flesh hanging off it. It animated the five dead guards as ghouls, and began to rip into Nubs, who quickly retreated. After a long and painful fight, you were able to defeat the demon and its undead, but not without using up precious resources. What was worse, no amount of pulling would get the Helm off of Ravengard\u2019s head.", "Following the prints further, you found a set of two even more recent prints leading into the back of the room. There, you found Annie and Naudi a set of very unique individuals. Annie appeared to be a halfling bard with no clue where she really was. Naudi was almost the opposite, a soft spoken tabaxi woman with a bit more knowledge of the situation they were in. They recounted following Ravengard into the dungeon and finding the Helm of Torm\u2019s Sight. Ravengard then went to meditate, and when they next saw him he was surrounded by demons, speaking nonsense, and all the other guards were dead. \n    Realizing that Ravengard was in real danger, Quildar led the others further into the dungeon, past a meditation room, into a room with a meditation pool. In this pool were the bodies of Ravengard\u2019s five dead guards, and Ravengard with the Helm on his head, gibbering in two distinct voices. Mynt, knowing Abyssal, was able to hear one of the voices, and was able to conclude it was a powerful demonic force fighting with some strong celestial being. This fight, however, was going on inside Ravengard\u2019s head.", "As you ventured down the stairs into the Cemetery, the first thing you found was a room full of shattered glass and embalming fluids and acids. In the liquids, Quildar found the footprints of eight humanoid creatures walking further into the dungeon, and the prints of many demons coming up the stairs. Going through the doors, Quildar followed the most recent set of prints into a larger room, with many bones resting in shelves along the walls. Kehnam, with his Detect Magic, discovered that every holy symbol resting with the bones was radiating necrotic magic.\n    Going further along, you found that the room with the holy symbols was a circular passage with two entrances. Hoping she would prove a safe tester, Nubs suggested that Mynt enter the room first. When nothing happened, Nubs went along after her, and when no one was looking, he grabbed one of the holy symbols. As soon as he touched it, it sent out a ripple of necromantic energy. At the same time, you heard a rumble from above. Clearly, the room was unsafe.", "Three New Arrivals\n    Before Subelle departed, Zel woke up and decided to go along with her, as her dreams made her distrustful of everyone else. Lulu and everyone else were sad to see them go, but it was what they needed to do. Before delving deeper into the cemetery, Nubs decided to plant his second to last bean. It sprouted a statue that was a perfect stone replica of Nubs. As he got closer, the statue began to animate and insult him, calling him the worst villain to ever walk the earth. Horrified, Nubs destroyed the statue with two blows of his quarterstaff. \n    Quildar, Kehnam, and Nubs realized they were the only three left of the original group that had agreed to take down Thalamra, and decided that they were each committed to saving Elturel no matter what. At that moment, a new arrival popped into existence in the middle of the group. Her name was Mynt, and she shyly explained that she had been sent by her patron: the Traveler. The rest of the group had a huddled discussion to decide what to do with her. You agreed that she could be helpful, but that she should stay behind Lulu\u2019s antimagic range, so they were safe from any magic betrayal.", "After killing the demons, Gideon told you that the demons only started coming up after a group of humans went down into the lower cemetery. Initially reluctant to let you through because you claimed to be helping him, Gideon was impressed by Nubs' resolve and agreed to let you down so they could kill some more demons. He warned you that he might not be so friendly on the way back up. \n        Deciding to rest before going down, Zel and others confronted Nubs on the deal he made with Zariel, realizing how terrifying it was that she could hear their thoughts. Before Zel started to take her nap, Subelle and Zel decided that they had had enough of Avernus, and that Elturel was beyond saving. Subelle tried to use her soul coin to call Bel, but no one responded. Angry, she threw the coin on the ground, but immediately regretted it as a piercing headache accompanied her actions: ones opposite to the deal she made with Bel. Eventually she decided that she would be of more help back in the refugee camp, triggering a tearful goodbye. Everyone regretted dragging a little girl into this, and everyone had a gift to give Subelle. After Subelle told Lulu that she was like the pet she never had, Lulu was so happy that she regained another memory: \n    \u201cIt was Zariel who sent me back here. I don\u2019t know why. Maybe---just maybe---there\u2019s a tiny little spark of goodness deep down inside her still.\u201d", "You moved on to the building. Inside was a single room, seemingly living quarters. Kehnam found a journal on the desk. Inside was the ramblings of a madman. Apparently kept by a priest named Gideon Lightward, the journal expressed Gideons hatred of demons, his appreciation for Zariel and all devils for fighting on the front lines against demons, and his hatred of celestials for not taking enough action. With more information on who you were dealing with, you decided to head into the back entrance of the chapel. \n        There was no way to avoid alerting the minotaur skeletons, so you had to fight them. Fortunately, Quildar was able to shatter them apart in just a few hits. Quildar quickly peeked into the center room, where Gideon was clearly waiting for a fight. Splitting up to surround him, your group ran in, and Kehnam magically charmed Gideon to stand still. With Gideon unable to move, you began to interrogate him, until demons started flooding up the stairs. Gideon begged Kehnam to free him so he could fight the demons, and Kehnam reluctantly did.", "Gideon Lightward\nBefore going into the building, Nubs decided to take a peek through the windows and see what was inside. He saw two minotaur skeletons standing guard, but also saw a tall black man in priest robes walk through, telling the skeletons to stay on the lookout for intruders. He then entered a central room concealed behind curtains. \n        You decided to sneak around the side of the building to see if there was a back entrance that could avoid alerting the man and his skeletons. In the back were two things, a pit resonating purple energy, and a small building. Kehnan determined that the pits energy was pulsing along with the Companion, and Yafeek thought it would be dangerous to step into. After a minute or so, a shadow emerged from the pit, but ignored you and went off the join the other undead roaming the cemetery. It seemed that a piece of the Companion had broken off and fallen here.", "While three had survived, one had already died before you found the group of monks. Thankful for the help, the leader of the monks healed Zel and Quildar. After reuniting with his old friends, Quildar told them to go back to the High Hall and protect the other survivors. \n        As you approached the Cemetery, it was clear something was wrong. Zombies and Minotaur skeletons were roaming around the grounds, and graves had clearly been vacated recently. The cemetery chapel itself was glowing with a purple light. Remembering that this is where Ravengard hoped to find the Helm of Torm\u2019s Sight, you headed towards the front doors.\n        In front of the building was 8 pillars, each one representing a different hero of Elturel's past. Kehnam, with his vast research and knowledge, was able to remember the names of the heroes, and Nubs realized that speaking the name of a hero could activate the pillar to ward off undead. \n        As Quildar started to open the doors, ghostly figures emerged from the pillars. A strange fight with shadows and specters ensued, but you were victorious in the end. Unfortunately, one of the specters was able to get away and warn others\u2026", "Nubs questioned Zariel on why she would want to help him, when his goals were absolutely against hers. Zariel retorted that his goals aligned more with hers than he thought, and asserted that there was no chance of Nubs and his companions saving Elturel. Despite her confidence, Nubs sensed a note of dishonest bravado in Zariel's words. Nubs then took the deal, and Zariel quickly flew back to her place in the blood war.\n        Shocked by this, but without much time to waste, you headed towards the Grand Cemetery, planning on stopping at Quildar's monastery on the way. At the monastery, Quildar found three of his old acquaintances trapped under a collapsed building. Without hesitating, he ran forward to save them. With the help of the rest of the group, the monks were painstakingly extracted from the building, even as a band of spined devils attempted to derail the rescue attempt.", "Zariel's Deal\nAs you prepared to leave for the Grand Cemetery, something very unexpected happened: Zariel appeared. Flying into the dungeon under the High Hall as a ball of light, Zariel came to cut a deal with Nubs. Everyone saw Zariel's terrifying visage, as well as the flail that replaced her left arm. In her right hand was a freezing cold hammer, clearly the most powerful weapon any of you had ever seen. Slightly hindered by Kehnam's attempt at a counterspell, Zariel encased her and Nubs in a ring of fire to have a conversation. \n        As Nubs was in Zariel's domain, she was able to tell that he strongly desired something he could use to save Elturel. Zariel chuckled at the idea that she would give away her extremely powerful hammer, but she offered him a lesser magical item, a gnarled \"Druid's Hammer\", which is wielded the same way a quarterstaff is, and increases in power when it's user casts spells. For Nubs' end of the deal, he promised to kill 999 demons before he died, or his soul would be forfeit to Zariel.", "Finally saving the High Hall from the devil attack, you spoke to Pherria Jynks, the figure of authority in the Hall, and an expert in possession and exorcism. While she didn\u2019t know how to go about saving Elturel, she knew that Ravengard recently led an expedition to the city\u2019s graveyard. It seemed that there was some sort of undead activity happening there. Ravengard was also hoping to find the Helm of Torm\u2019s Sight, a legendary helm that could give you some insight into how to save Elturel, if the legends are to be believed. Ravengard was supposed to be hours ago, and Pherria was afraid that something had happened to him. She insisted that you rest, however, before pursuing him.", "After defeating the three mummies and avoiding contracting any mummy rot, Kehnam investigated the magic items. One was a bracer of defense, which was given to Subelle due to her fragile nature. The other item was a yellow diamond elemental gem, which was given to Nubs. Continuing on, you found that one of the crypts held a group of dead townsfolk, brutally murdered only recently, and decided to hurry. \n    Coming in a loop to the front of the catacombs, you saw a dragon-devil creature negotiating a contract with a woman who seemed to be the leader of the remaining survivors. Nubs, who had grown much larger due to a magic fruit he ate, snuck up in the form of a wolf spider and began the attack. Aided with surprise, the fight seemed to be going well, until the fully grown land shark that Nubs had planted earlier jumped out and landed on half of the group, devouring Trevick. Fortunately, Quildar landed a pressure point punch inside of the shark\u2019s mouth, leaving it stunned until the group could clean up the shark and the devil creature.", "Mummy Magic\n    During the short rest, Zel decided to inquire into each party member\u2019s background. As this began to feel more like an interrogation and tensions rose, heated arguments began to form. Kehnam was extremely touchy about his past as a slave for the cult of the Dead Three, unwilling to specify exactly how he got his magic. Quildar was similarly unwilling to give the details of his past, but relented under Zel\u2019s stubborn inquisition. Subelle expressed the desire to leave the group after Elturel was saved, but agreed that she had formed a sort of bond with  everyone in the group. Nubs for his part seemed rather annoyed at the whole conversation. After Lulu expressed her desire that everyone remain friends, you decided to journey further into the crypts.\n    Kehnam used Detect Magic to search for anything hidden, while Quildar led the way by scouting ahead. Soon, you found a potion of healing and some gems hidden away behind some bones. The catacombs were filled with many small crypts for devoted worshipers of Torm, as well as lots of twists and turns. Eventually, you came upon a larger room, with detailed sarcophagi containing all the previous high priests of Torm. In one of these sarcophagi, Kehnam detected some sort of necromantic creature, along with some magic items. Using his thieves tools to pry open the sarcophagus, a battle against three mummies began.", "Having explored the upper floor, you headed down into the secret door within the hand altar of Torm. At the bottom of the stairs you found a small tomb to the unknown hero of Elturel. Reya recalled that this woman killed a dragon that was terrorizing the city long ago, and died as the rest of the townsfolk reached her to congratulate her. She was buried in a special place in the cathedral, and some speculated she was an embodiment of Torm. Next to her body was a magical greatsword named Redemption, that Zel took to attune to later.\n    As you explored the tomb, Quildar began to hear a tapping sound. Soon, the entire group began to hear the sound as well. Suddenly, giant infernal crabs, smelling of brimstone, started to come around every corner. After defending from these crabs for a bit, their controller revealed himself: he was none other than the barbed devil you had killed in Thalamra\u2019s dungeon. You quickly defeated him for the second time, and decided you had to take a rest before you continued any further. Before the rest, however, Nubs planted a magic bean, creating what seemed to be a baby fish that burrowed into the ground.", "After a brief argument where Zel got mad at Nubs for not healing her during the fight, you decided to head upstairs to see if you could gather any more survivors before heading into the crypts. On the balcony, you found a massive organ who\u2019s keys practically glowed. Subelle sat down to play the tune of the Elfsong Tavern, and played a fairly impressive melody. After she finished, Kehnam, proficient in musical performance, played a tune. But his hands unwillingly began to play a disjointed infernal melody, calling forth another group of fiends that had been lurking.\n    Among this group was a merregon, a lower devil formed by the soul of an evil mercenary or warrior. After defeating this creepy creature, you explored further, finding an outdoor balcony and two guard posts. You also found a guard, curled up in a ball, named Trevick. When the hall was attacked he hid in the guard post while the rest of the guards ran down to die. Kehnam and Zel convinced him that he could prove he wasn\u2019t a coward by helping them rescue more townsfolk from the devils.", "Searching for Survivors\nDuring the previous fight, Lulu had gone into the midst of the fight, relying on the rest of the group to heal her if she went down. That trust worked out well, and after Nubs healed her, Lulu felt that her friendship with the group had grown. This unlocked a new memory from within the ones that Lulu had forgotten:\n    \u201cThe Zariel I knew is gone, replaced by a devil with a halo of fire and vengeance. \u2018This is who I am,\u2019 she told me. \u2018When demons die, they cry out my name in terror.\u2019 Those were Zariel\u2019s last words to me.\u201d", "Coming back to the group, Nubs talked to the druid, whose name was Seltern Obranch. In an attempt to reinspire his connection to nature, Nubs planted a magic bean into a crack in the floor, and soon a giant tree grew with many different fruits. Eating one, Nubs found that it\u2019s magical effect caused him to get younger by 12 years. Zel also ate a fruit, but found that while they were all delicious, not every fruit had a magical effect. Seeing this amazing growth in such a barren place, Seltern realized that his resolve had just been shaken, and was again able to use his druidic magic.\n    In thanks, the druid revealed the effect of the lever near the altar: it caused the massive fist to open. Seltern then showed you the secret door within the palm of the hand that leads into the catacombs of the Hall. He mentioned that most of the survivors fled underground, but that some also fled to the upper floors of the building.", "After the fight, many things happened at once. Nubs, now changed into a monkey, chased after a spined devil that had escaped beyond another curtain. From a side alcove came a druid who claimed he could heal the party, but it seemed that he had lost his connection to nature after entering Avernus. Quildar simultaneously realized that the great altar to Torm in the form of a giant fist in the center of the room most likely had healing properties. Lo and behold, anyone who touched it and prayed to Torm was fully healed. \n    In the other room, Nubs found an altar that had been completely desecrated, weakening any mortal who came near it. After defeating the devil in the room, Nubs managed to restore the altar by praying to Torm. Meanwhile, Subelle accidentally revealed that she had made a deal with Bel, an archdevil. He gave her the ability to reawaken while dying in the midst of combat, and asked for a single soul coin in repayment. After making sure he got all this information from her, Kehnam agreed to help her complete this contract, but found that he had lost his soul coin. Unknown to him, Subelle had already stolen it from him while invisible.", "Attack on the High Hall\nThe first thing you noticed when you approached the High Hall was the Hell Hounds guarding the entrance. Fortunately, you were able to stay in cover as you approached them, and managed to surprise them, scoring quick damage before they were able to react. The fight ended soon thereafter. Unfortunately, the next fight didn\u2019t go quite as well.\n    As you entered the High Hall, you noticed that the art decorated in honor of Torm had been defaced as the city had entered Avernus. Pillars that had once been beautiful now showed images of devil victory and dominance over mortals, and portrayed a winged devil with a large sword instead of Torm.\n    Inside the High Hall was a grand chapel, sectioned off by curtains. In the entrance were two spiral staircases leading up. As you peeked through the curtains leading into the center chamber, you noticed two spined devils leading a pack of crazed humans. As you rushed out to attack, the devils egged the humans on into attacking you. Experienced now with how to deal with these spinagons, you quickly dispatched them, but the humans were something else. It took many resources to take them out, when it was unknown how long you would get until a rest in this oppressive atmosphere.", "i do like to parse the dense adventure text lol", "bc it all makes perfect snese to me and feels like it combines into a logical pattern", "i think that this sort of thing is something that a lot of people would just try to mentally skip through but its the exact kind of thing my brain is built for", "ok reading this it couldve been run a lot clearer from our dm", "it just gives a different boon and might unlock some things", "but its not necessary from what i can tell", "you can get to the area that takes longer to get to", "which is like if you're going ahead of schedule", "technically 5", "he just thought we needed to do more for some reason", "also we only needed to do 4 encounters to be on track", "we could've gone a lot faster things just weren't set up optimally", "and the sarcophagus was kinda a red herring that if you touched it you got tleeported inside", "there was a riddle we were supposed to solve", "ok so the elixir thing was hidden inside a puzzle on the wall", "lol thats confusing", "was that dungeon just not thre?", "yeah i remember", "what was it", "so once story quest 3 is done they would've assigned 4", "basically the story quests unlock one after another and the admins are supposed to choose who does them", "the document IS really big but its mostly just the maps and the boons and stat blocks", "the story things are just for fun", "its just about having 20 vicotry points per table", "ok i read the adventure and we did win", "im going to download the adventure and figure out what the mistake is myself", "theres 4 minutes left so i dont think we'ere doing another quest today", "i mean he's a bit confused", "give me leather", "i mean he didnt take any damage", "the vampire shouldve hit bc it met his ac", "VAMPIRE FORGOT THE RULES SO BEN LIVES", "we're not gonna get a full victory lol", "yeah wait saving throws should be made so that you always roll if you're the player", "you just always miss for some reason", "i thnk they're good?", "i would politely remind them that you requested to be in that table if that changes anything", "he said i could just have a sheet with the basics in roll20", "I sent him erni and we're talking about the cunning action booming blade combo", "Already liking our dm for the epic next weekend", "if anyone else wants to on saturday at 10 lmk bc its not filling up too quick", "ok i got two for me and neil", "Yeah sadly I'm busy then but you can do it on your own or with someone else if u want", "I said it earlier in the chat", "Its not great knucklehead rally we're doing <@327620813341851651> its a different one", "i can pretty much only do slot 7 though", "its in easter time", "if youwanna sign up for a different one this is the scheudle", "its free and you can use your s10 character you made for the last con as long as its level 1 or 2", "ok im gonna reserve spots for saturday at 10 am by this evening, please say here if you want to play the game......", "i mean i can friday but saturday si better", "can you saturday at 10 am", "me neither saturaday is better for me", "im probaby gonna reserve seats this afternoon so decide quickly so i can get us in one table if we want to", "An avalanche has stranded you and your allies in the treacherous Spine of the World, and a relentless blizzard is quickly blowing away all hope of survival.
